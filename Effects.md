	- You can't bring yourself to move any closer to [the source of the effect].

## Mechanics

### Overkill
When you kill any creature by dealing an amount of damage that is greater than 50% of that creature's Max HP, you cause the 'overkill' mechanic to kick in.
Overkilling an enemy causes it to explode, painting the dungeon red with blood. Additionally, other enemies in sight have a 25% chance to become *terrified*.
