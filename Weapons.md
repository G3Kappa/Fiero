# Weapons
The player can equip a melee and a ranged weapon simultaneously, the latter only being used to (automatically) shoot projectiles like arrows.

## Melee

## Ranged
Ranged weapons, also known as *launchers*, will empower all thrown items that match their ammunition type.
### Slings
Slings empower **stones**. They change their trajectory from a **parabola** to a **straight line** and significantly increase their **range** and **damage**.
Essentially, this turns stones into arrows. The drawback is that you can't toss them behind NPCs anymore but the upside is that stones are much more common than arrows.
### Bows
Bows empower **arrows** by giving them **near-perfect accuracy**. They also have a **low action cost** allowing you to shoot at twice the normal rate of fire.
The downside is that arrows are pretty scarce, and bows eat them up quickly without really improving their damage output. But at least your mobility is not hindered.
### Crossbows
Crossbows empower **arrows**. They grant **penetration** in the direction of travel and significantly boost their **damage**.
The downside is that the **action cost** for shooting arrows **increases**, making it a slower and riskier weapon to use.
### Blasters
Blasters empower **potions** by granting them **more charges**. By interacting with the blaster, you can **load its empty tank** with
a potion of your choice. Then, whenever you fire the blaster, you'll **consume one charge** from its tank and spit out a **short-range linear projectile** with the potion's **throw effect**.
### Staves
Staves empower **wands**
### Cannons
Cannons improve **bombs**. They change their trajectory from a **parabola** to a **straight line** and launch them with enough force to **detonate on impact**.
Bombs are a very rare and useful resource, but cannons can imbue them with enchantments that would be pretty difficult to find on random bombs otherwise.
