% Bombs leave a fake solid 'bomb' dummy on the ground for as long as the fuse is lit.
% Dummies are a special type of actor that do basically nothing while being inserted in the flow of turns.
% The effect of the fuse is attached to this dummy, so if the dummy moves from its original position, so will the fuse animation and explosion.
% The dummy is given the 'invulnerable' trait when it spawns, which locks its health in place (to 1).
% This trait is removed when the fuse runs out and the effect ends. As soon as the trait is removed, an explosion is triggered.
% The explosion automatically takes care of killing the now-vulnerable dummy.
% Since the dummy is NOT impassible, effects work on it! You can teleport a lit bomb around and it will explode elsewhere.
