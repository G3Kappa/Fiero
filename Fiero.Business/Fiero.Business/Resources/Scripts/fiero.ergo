% This file manages the integration between the game and the Ergo interpreter.
% Do not modify unless you know what you are doing.

%%% Intercepts all calls to the write_* predicates (except write_raw).
%%% Instead of writing to the console, messages will be routed to the script's stdout.
%%% This lets the game display them in their own window, bypassing the shell and keeping them separate.
