% This module decides which map script to run when generating a given FloorId.
% Map scripts can define event handlers just like regular game scripts, however
% the map scripts are loaded and unloaded automatically when the player changes area.
% Additionally, map scripts, unlike regular scripts, can define floor generation steps.
